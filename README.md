# A latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for taxi trips

## How do the New York City and San Francisco taxi markets differ? 

I used timestamped GPS data on taxi pickup and dropoffs to classify different types of trips in each city. 


## The Model

LDA is an unsupervised learning model that originally developed to classify text documents into topics. But it can also be used to classify trips based on their spatial and temporal attributes. 

## The Data

## Results

## Project Status

The jupyter notebooks contain the code I used for data preparation, model building, and some visualization. 
The code is untested and not very clean. In the future I may find time make it more reproducible.
